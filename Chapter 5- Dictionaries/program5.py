### Exercise 4: Rivers :ballot_box_with_check:

#Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.

#* Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.

#* Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.

#* Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

### Exercise 5: Pets :ballot_box_with_check:

#Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the

#ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and asyou do, print everything you know about 

#each pet
