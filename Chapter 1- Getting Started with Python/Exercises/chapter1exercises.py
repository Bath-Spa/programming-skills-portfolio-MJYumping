#This program asks you to input two numbers, adds them, then shows you the result. :)
num1 = int(input("Enter a number and press enter: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter a second number to add to the previous number: "))

#This program adds the two numbers that the user entered previously and places it within a variable named "sum." :)
sum = num1 + num2

#This program displays the sum
print("Your number is:",sum)
